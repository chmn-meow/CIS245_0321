# this week's req's
# This week we will work with functions. For this weekâ€™s assignment, write a program that uses a function to convert miles to kilometers.
# Your program should prompt the user for the number of miles driven then call a function which converts miles to kilometers.
# The program should then display the total miles and the kilometers.

# We will be using a simple formula for converting
# but, we'll go both ways for future utility
# mi -> km is mi * 1.609344
# km -> mi is km / 1.609344
# for now, we're just going to go with a global constant
CONST = 1.609344

# define dict for future util
units_of_measure = {
    "metric": {"distance": [], "mass": [], "volume": []},
    "imperial": {"distance": [], "mass": [], "volume": []},
}

# define the function. Try to leave simple and open for future utility; decide later for dict lookup inside/outside of function call
